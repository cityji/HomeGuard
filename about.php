                <p class="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                    Historically, The Civil Defence Policy of the Government of India, till the declaration of Emergency
                    in 1962, was confined to making the States and Union Territories conscious of the need of civil
                    protection measures and to ask them to keep ready civil protection paper plans for major cities and
                    towns under the then Emergency Relief Organization (ERO) Scheme. The Chinese aggression in 1962 and
                    the Indo- Pak conflict in 1965 led to a considerable re-thinking about the policy and scope of Civil 
                    Defence. The Civil Defence Act, 1968 (Act 27 of 1968) was passed by Parliament in May 1968. The Act
                    extends to the whole of India and provides for among other things measures not amounting to actual 
                    combat, for affording protection to any person, property, place or thing in India or any part of the 
                    territory thereof against any hostile attack, whether from air, land, sea or other places, or for 
                    depriving any such attack of the whole or part of its effects, whether such measures are taken before, 
                    during, at or after the time of such attack. It also authorized the raising of Civil Defence Corps and 
                    for making Rules and Regulations for Civil Defence.
